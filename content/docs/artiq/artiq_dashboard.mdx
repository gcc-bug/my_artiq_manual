# Using the ARTIQ Dashboard

The ARTIQ dashboard is a graphical user interface that allows users to interact with the ARTIQ master. It facilitates experiment scheduling, device management, and real-time monitoring of results. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and use the ARTIQ dashboard.

## 1. Setting Up the Environment

### Prepare ARTIQ
Ensure ARTIQ is installed.


### Prepare the Master Directory
Create a directory to serve as the ARTIQ master directory and copy the device database (`device_db.py`) into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/artiq-master
cp device_db.py ~/artiq-master/device_db.py
```

### Create the Repository Folder

```bash
mkdir ~/artiq-master/repository
```

## 2. Starting the ARTIQ Master

The ARTIQ master is responsible for scheduling and executing experiments. To start it, run:

```bash
cd ~/artiq-master
artiq_master
```

This command keeps running in the background, indicating that the master is active.

## 3. Launching the ARTIQ Dashboard

Open a new terminal and start the dashboard:

```bash
artiq_dashboard
```

The dashboard interface will appear, displaying various sections such as "Explorer," "Log," and "Schedule."

## 4. Submitting and Managing Experiments

### Adding an Experiment
Save your experiment scripts in the `repository` folder. For example, create `hello_world.py`:

```python
from artiq.experiment import *

class HelloWorld(EnvExperiment):
    """Hello World Experiment"""
    def build(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        print("Hello, World!")
```

### Rescanning the Repository
If the new experiment does not appear in the "Explorer" dock, right-click inside the "Explorer" and select **Scan repository HEAD** to refresh the list.

### Submitting an Experiment
Click on the experiment in the "Explorer" dock, configure any required arguments, and click **Submit**.

### Monitoring Execution
- The **Log** dock displays real-time output from running experiments.
- The **Schedule** tab shows the status of submitted experiments.

## 5. Utilizing Git Integration (Optional)

### Initialize a Git Repository

```bash
cd ~/artiq-master/repository
git init --bare
```

### Set Up a Working Directory

```bash
mkdir ~/artiq-work
cd ~/artiq-work
git init
git remote add origin ~/artiq-master/repository
```

### Committing and Pushing Changes

After editing or adding experiments in `~/artiq-work`:

```bash
git add experiment.py
git commit -m "Add new experiment"
git push origin master
```

### Configuring Automatic Repository Scans

Create a `post-receive` hook to automatically rescan the repository upon new commits:

```bash
echo '#!/bin/sh
artiq_client scan-repository --async' > ~/artiq-master/repository/hooks/post-receive
chmod +x ~/artiq-master/repository/hooks/post-receive
```

This setup ensures that the dashboard reflects the latest committed experiments without manual rescans.


The ARTIQ dashboard provides an efficient way to manage and monitor quantum experiments. By following this guide, we can set up your environment, submit experiments, and integrate version control with Git. For more advanced features, refer to the [ARTIQ manual](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/manual/management_system.html).
