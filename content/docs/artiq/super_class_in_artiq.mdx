## Why ARTIQ Requires Special Handling with Superclass

In Python, when using multiple inheritance, classes follow the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** to decide which superclass's method to invoke (see [super.md](../python/super.md) for more). For a typical example like your `UnifiedTheory` class, Python's MRO resolves which superclass methods to call, and `super()` works seamlessly because Python manages inheritance internally.

However, ARTIQ's `EnvExperiment` introduces complexities that differ from typical Python classes. This is due to how ARTIQ handles experiment lifecycle and initialization, requiring explicit conformance to its structure.

### Key Differences Between Normal Python Classes and ARTIQ Experiments

1. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - ARTIQ experiments are managed by the ARTIQ runtime, which relies on specific lifecycle methods (`build`, `prepare`, `run`, etc.). These methods are invoked in a specific order by the ARTIQ runtime and not by Python's default object initialization process (`__init__`).
   - `EnvExperiment` does not use `__init__` for initialization. Instead, attributes and devices are set up in the `build` method.

   **Normal Python Classes**:
   ```python
   class BaseClass:
       def __init__(self):
           print("Base class initialized")

   class SubClass(BaseClass):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()
           print("Subclass initialized")

   obj = SubClass()  # Works as expected
   ```

   **ARTIQ Experiment**:
   ```python
   from artiq.experiment import *

   class MyExperiment(EnvExperiment):
       def build(self):
           self.setattr_device("core")  # Initialization happens here

       def prepare(self):
           pass

       def run(self):
           pass
   ```

2. **No Standard `__init__`**:
   - ARTIQ experiments rely on the `build` method to initialize experiment attributes and devices. Calling `super().__init__()` on `EnvExperiment` doesn't work because `EnvExperiment` doesn't define a traditional `__init__` method.
   - This is why directly inheriting from `EnvExperiment` requires careful use of ARTIQ's lifecycle methods.

3. **Specialized Execution Environment**:
   - ARTIQ experiments are executed in a real-time environment controlled by the ARTIQ runtime. This imposes restrictions on Python's dynamic method calls and object initialization.

4. **Multiple Inheritance Order**:
   - When combining `EnvExperiment` with another class (e.g., `SensorDataWriter`), Python's MRO might conflict with ARTIQ's expectations. Specifically, `EnvExperiment` requires its methods (`build`, `prepare`, `run`) to align with the ARTIQ runtime.
   - To avoid issues, you must:
     - Place `EnvExperiment` first in the inheritance list.
     - Explicitly initialize the second parent class (e.g., `SensorDataWriter`) in the `prepare` method.

### Why `super()` Behaves Differently
In your ARTIQ example, the `super()` call cannot resolve `EnvExperiment.__init__` because:
- `EnvExperiment` does not implement a traditional `__init__` method.
- Its lifecycle is designed around `build`, `prepare`, and `run` methods instead.

This is fundamentally different from normal Python classes, where `super().__init__()` can cascade through the parent classes without issue.

### ARTIQ-Specific Solution
To properly handle ARTIQ experiments with multiple inheritance:
1. **Prioritize `EnvExperiment`:** Place it first in the inheritance list.
2. **Initialize Parent Classes in `prepare`:** Explicitly call the second parent class's initializer in the `prepare` method, as `build` is reserved for ARTIQ device setup.

Correct implementation:
```python
from artiq.experiment import *

class SensorDataWriter:
    def __init__(self, data_directory=None, buffer_size=None):
        self.data_directory = data_directory or "/default/path"
        self.buffer_size = buffer_size or 1024

class SaveDataExample(EnvExperiment, SensorDataWriter):
    def build(self):
        self.setattr_device("core")

    def prepare(self):
        # Initialize SensorDataWriter here
        SensorDataWriter.__init__(self, data_directory="/my/data", buffer_size=2048)

    def run(self):
        print(f"Data directory: {self.data_directory}, Buffer size: {self.buffer_size}")
```

### Notes for Future Use
- **ARTIQ Lifecycle:** Always use `build`, `prepare`, and `run` for ARTIQ experiments.
- **Avoid `__init__` in `EnvExperiment`:** Instead, rely on `build` for device attributes and `prepare` for other initialization.
- **Documentation:** Refer to ARTIQ's official documentation for details on lifecycle methods and device management.

This approach ensures compatibility with ARTIQ's runtime while adhering to Python's multiple inheritance principles.
