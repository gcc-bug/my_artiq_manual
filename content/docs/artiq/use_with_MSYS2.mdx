# How to Install `matplotlib` in MSYS2

When working with Python packages in MSYS2, it’s important to choose the correct environment. The default MSYS environment doesn’t provide many Python packages, including `matplotlib`. Instead, these packages are typically available in the MinGW-w64 environments, such as the Clang64 environment.

## 1. Understanding MSYS2 Environments

**MSYS2** provides multiple environments:

- **MSYS (Native Environment)**:  
  - Focuses on POSIX tools and utilities.  
  - Not suited for installing Python libraries like `matplotlib`.

- **MinGW-w64 Environments (e.g., Clang64)**:  
  - Provide a Windows-native toolchain.  
  - Feature extensive Python packages (including `matplotlib`) via `pacman` and allow easy setup of `pip`.

**Key Point:** Always switch to a MinGW-w64 environment when installing Python packages.

## 2. Selecting the Correct Environment

Before attempting to install `matplotlib`, open the **MSYS2 MinGW Clang64** shell. This environment’s path typically looks like:

```bash
MSYS2 MinGW x64 → /mingw64
MSYS2 MinGW Clang64 → /clang64
```

In this guide, we use **Clang64** as the example environment.

## 3. Installing `matplotlib` Using `pacman`

In the Clang64 environment, many Python packages are available via `pacman`. To install `matplotlib`, simply run:

```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python-matplotlib
```

If this command works successfully, you’re done. `matplotlib` is now installed and ready to use. You can verify it by running:

```bash
python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"
```

## 4. If `pip` is Not Available (Alternative Installation Method)

In some cases, you may prefer (or need) to use `pip` to install `matplotlib`. If `pip` is not yet installed in the Clang64 environment, follow these steps:

1. **Install `pip` with `pacman`:**

   ```bash
   pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python-pip
   ```
   
   This integrates `pip` into your `/clang64` Python environment.

2. **Verify `pip` Installation:**
   
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```

   If you see the version number, `pip` is correctly installed.

3. **Install `matplotlib` Using `pip`:**

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

4. **Verify the Installation:**

   ```bash
   python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"
   ```

If the above command prints the version number, `matplotlib` is installed and functional.

## 5. Summary

- **Use the MinGW-w64 Environment (e.g., Clang64):**  
  `matplotlib` and other Python packages are available here, not in the default MSYS environment.

- **Install via `pacman` or `pip`:**  
  - `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python-matplotlib`  
  - If needed, `pacman -S mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-python-pip` followed by `pip install matplotlib`.

- **Check Your Installation:**  
  Use `python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"` to ensure the package is correctly installed.

By following these steps and understanding the differences between MSYS2 environments, you can successfully install and use `matplotlib` (and other Python packages) in MSYS2.
